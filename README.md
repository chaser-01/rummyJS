# rummyJS

rummyJS is intended to be a package for modelling a game of Rummy (and similar variants). It's fairly comprehensive, featuring:
    -Standard player moves
    -Mid-game player additions/removals
    -Gamestate validation
    -Strict game flow
    -Scorekeeping
    -Error and game move logging
    
    It's also extensible, as variants can be created by extending base classes as necessary.
